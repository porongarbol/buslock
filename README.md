# Buslock explorer
This is a basic instances explorer for Roblox.<br/>
Loads quick and well, it's just quick (unlike Dex)

# What I found out after making the script
Dex uses a very similar implementation to mine, using linked lists and a custom scrolling functionality.<br/>
So I am still investigating why is Dex so slow and I'll try to fix Dex rather than finishing this explorer.

# Additional notes
I made this because I wanted to make a script for a game in Roblox but Dex wasn't working.<br/>
I hate exploiting. So I hope this never gets used for actual exploiting in Roblox, and if it does: well, you suck!
